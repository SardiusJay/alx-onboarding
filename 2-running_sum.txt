We want two things, the sum and average of even numbers from 1 to 50.

Sum of even numbers can also be represented as:  ∑n=1252n 

We can push out the  2  as a constant, and evaluate  2⋅ ∑n=125n=2⋅ 25⋅ 262=650 

Since we are considering our upper bound as  50 , we can infer there are  25  even numbers.

The average would be  125⋅ ∑n=1252n=65025=26 

Enough of math, let’s get to the programming part of this (:

The logic would remain the same, irrespective of the language.

sum = 0

count = 25

for i in range(26):

sum += (2*i)

print(sum)

print(int(sum/count))
